This coffee is from a privately owned communal wet mill in Kochere (in the Gedeo zone that also includes Yirgacheffe), called “Qore”, named after the kebele where it is located. The washing station is owned by Israel Degfa. Qore means "sharp", as in sharp as a knife or sharp spikes on plants.

Many of Israel's washing stations are great simply due to their location and altitude, and he is building on this potential quality by investing in better systems and protocols.


Post Harvest

Fermentation
The parchment is fermented in water for 36-72 hours. Fermentation is slower at higher altitudes as temperatures are generally lower.

Washing and grading in channels
Coffees are washed in channels, and graded in water by density. The lower density (lower quality) will float and are removed, leaving only the denser and therefore higher quality beans which are separated as higher grade lots.

Soaked under clean water
Parchment is then soaked in tanks in clean water for 6-12 hours before it is moved to the drying tables.

Drying and handsorting
Parchment is dried on raised beds in the sun for 12 - 15 days. The time depends on the thickness of the layers and temperatures. For the premium grades they will continuously sort the parchment at the drying tables. Coffees are piled up and covered in shade nets or plastic during the hottest hours of the day and overnight.
