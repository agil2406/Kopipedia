Frinsa Estate is a family business owned by Wildan Mustofa and his wife Atieq. He’s oldest son Fikri is also starting to get involved now as he’s completed his degree. The first project started in Sindangkerta, Weninggalih area in 2010. This later became the main growing area of Java Frinsa Estate.

This is third second release of single varieties from 2019 harvest from Frinsa Estate. We cupped this together with Pak Wildan and his son Fikri at our HQ earlier on July. We felt really lucky to share this nano lot with you.

The coffees are picked and then hand sorted from unripe cherries. Then they put in small tanks for 72 hours with bacteria added in anaerob condition. The fermented cherry is then slowly dried on raised beds for 20 days.
