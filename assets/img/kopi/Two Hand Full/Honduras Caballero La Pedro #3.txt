Marysabel Caballero and her husband Moises Herrera are working with over 200 hectares of land, planted with coffee. They are 2nd and 3rd generation coffee farmers and have been rewarded many times for his commitment to developing coffee quality in Honduras. Our importer partner, Nordic Approach has been buying coffee from them since 2012.

They have since been extremely successful producing quality coffees and have contributed to the improving reputation of Honduran quality coffees. Everything they do at the farms is documented, and they invest considerable time and resources both in new equipment and planting of new coffee varieties in order to improve the quality of the coffee. The main cultivar at Caballero is Catuai. They also have other cultivars like Java and Pacamara as well as Geishas.


Process

After de-pulping the mucilage is removed with the use of a Penagos aqua pulper. Then the parchment is fermented for 12 hours before it is washed using african washing techniques which helps sorting floaters and undeveloped beans from the denser and more developed coffee. After washing, the beans are soaked for about 12 hours in running clean water.

The coffee is then dried on patio, raised beds in the sun or shade for 11 – 20 days. The coffees are piled up and covered when its hard sun during mid day, when it rains and at night.
